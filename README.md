# Automatic Co-segmentation

## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to automate the segmentation process by identifying common features across multiple images to segment the desired object. The entire work is conducted on Google Colab, making it accessible without specific system requirements.

### Models Used
- **Segment Anything Model (SAM)**: A versatile model for general segmentation tasks.
- **Personalised Segment Anything (Per-SAM)**: Customized segmentation tailored to specific needs.
- **Visual Saliency Transformer (VST)**: A model that focuses on identifying visually salient regions in images.
